"""
Advanced Failure Detection Methods for Hybrid CRNN-SRP System

This module implements sophisticated failure detection methods beyond simple thresholding:
- Temperature Scaling (calibration)
- Mahalanobis Distance (OOD detection in feature space)
- ConfidNet (learned confidence estimation)
- Circular Statistics (directional uncertainty)
